NEXT
- Step through game for communication between Activity/GM
- Graphics/Animation: Android guide (canvas on view?), GIMP for art?, Alert 
Dialogues 
- Look for all error calls and anything else in the comments that needs 
implementing
- Fullscreen: Implement sticky, see article for potential additions
	- Can't really look at this until I can properly test/emulate. OK to 
leave and work on art, activity commands.

GRAPHICS/ANIMATIONS NEEDED
- Cards, Numbers, Player Names, Table
- Buttons, Option Popups
- Cards dealt, actions (communicate hit/bust etc.), maybe money dealt
- Sounds? Money, cards, maybe win/loss noises

THOUGHTS
- For each player check that nextPlayer() exists. If player, stay button needs 
to trigger next AI turn, else an AI turn needs to start.
- Graphics/Information: Pick appropriate card based on value, send to direction 
of screen based on PlayerType
