- Extend View and define onDraw(). Called by Android framework to request view 
draw itself. A Canvas object is passed, which you use within the method to 
draw the object. 
- Calling invalidate() on your view indicates you'd like your 
view to be redrawn, and Android will call onDraw().
- Inside onDraw(), use the Canvas to draw, using Canvas.draw...() methods, or 
other class draw() methods that take the Canvas as an argument.
- Use .png for drawables.

- Drawable animations allow you to specify multiple drawables in an animation 
xml, which can the be loaded and started in activity. Property seems more 
complicated, as I'm using drawables, and not too many animations, could try it 
for now.
