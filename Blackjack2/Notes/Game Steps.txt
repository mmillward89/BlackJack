GAME STEPS
- Pick high/med/low bet
	- input for reference, call setBetMinimum()
- Ask for amount to bet (need to check this isn't too much)
	- call setBets(), pass results from BetStorage to display
- Display cards and dealing animation (show one for dealer)
	- dealCards(), pass results and playertype, trigger animations
- Animation during AI turn for each hit, stay and result triggered
	- Might need to refactor method to use hit/stay that player uses
	- Hide buttons while AI plays
- React to hit/stay/quit buttons
	- Send similar response for hit/stay/result type
- Show final result and money totals changing
	- Send results from startScorer(), money from confirm Winnings() and 
BetStorage
- Kick player from game if money = 0
