THOUGHTS
should player hit 
- take account of cards shown around table?
- might have to adjust dependent on player performance, don't want them always 
winning or losing
- could also improve should player bet
- option to keep betting consistent? avoid repeated popup questions

VEGAS MODE
- Drinking/Luck: As players drink, they bet more, but their odds improve (how? 
More chances to draw the card they need?) Drink effect wears off over turns/
drinking water.
- Events: Picking fights, strippers, drugs(?), security, stag/hen nights
- Card Counting/Multiple Decks: Check online for full 'vegas' rules, cc could 
potentially allow player to do it, or opponent
