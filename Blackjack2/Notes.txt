should player hit 
- take account of cards shown around table?
- might have to adjust dependent on player performance, don't want them always 
winning or losing
- could also improve should player bet

NEXT
- Look at setting up full/blank activity
- Look at animation/graphic design possibilities
- Need to communicate results to activity, another enum for animation types
(draw card/bust etc.)?

GAME STEPS
- Pick high/med/low bet - set bet minimum appropriately
- Ask for amount to bet (need to check this isn't too much)
- Display cards and dealing animation (show one for dealer)
- Show animation and make check as each player hits, stays, bust, blackjack etc.
- React to hit/stay/quit buttons
	- Hide buttons while AI plays
- Show final result and money totals changing
- Kick player from game if money = 0

GRAPHICS/ANIMATIONS NEEDED
- Cards, Numbers, Player Names, Table
- Buttons, Option Popups
- Cards dealt, actions (communicate hit/bust etc.), maybe money dealt
- Sounds? Money, cards, maybe win/loss noises
